  also checked your code. I like the way you execute the code because if in the future you want to change
  any of your variables so then the game will act according to this changes. 
 Very well implementation of the drag and drop method and using javascript to manipulate the DOM
ALso liked the randoms aspects of your games. 
Very good Job. 
I will only point you should order your html in a better way. I will show you in this file.
First you want your scipt tags to be in the end of your body. Then also if you make a jump of line in the 
opening html tag the the closing must be in a new line after you close the opening tag.-->
